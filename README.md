# NinDeals

A clean, fast way to find the best discounts in the Nintendo eShop. NinDeals scans the full game catalog in seconds and shows every title with its real discount percentage, sorted and filterable right in the browser.

## Features

- Scans the entire eShop catalog automatically, no manual pagination
- Filter by console: Switch, Switch 2 or both
- Filter by minimum discount percentage
- Filter by price range
- Search by title
- Sort by discount, price or name
- Click any game to open its official Nintendo product page

## How it works

NinDeals queries Nintendo of Europe's public search API directly from the browser to pull the full catalog, then does all filtering and sorting client-side.

Browsers block cross-origin requests like this by default (CORS). To work around it:

- When run locally through start.bat or start.sh, server.py acts as a small same-origin proxy, so requests never hit the CORS restriction in the first place.
- When hosted as static files with no server (like GitHub Pages), the app falls back to a small list of public CORS proxies instead.

This means the local version is the most reliable. The hosted static version depends on a third-party proxy staying available.

## Project structure

index.html    Page layout and controls
styles.css    Styling
app.js        Fetching, filtering, sorting and rendering
server.py     Local static file server with CORS proxy endpoint
start.bat     Windows launcher
start.sh      macOS / Linux launcher

## Limitations

- Relies on an undocumented public Nintendo API. Field names are matched defensively with fallbacks, but Nintendo could change the response shape at any time.
- The static (non-local) version depends on third-party CORS proxies, which can be slow, rate-limited, or temporarily down.
